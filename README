This script extracts and displays tab URLs
from a Firefox Session Manager add-on file (backup.session and alike).

Also optionally opens them in your default browser, as separate tabs/windows.

Use '--help' command-line option to see all details.

Tested on Windows, but should work on Linux as-is.
Feel free to report problems or send patches if it doesn't.
